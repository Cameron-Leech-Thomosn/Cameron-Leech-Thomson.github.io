					<p>Here you can find various posts about my projects; detailing what went into them, why I liked it,
						or why it was a pain!
					</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<p></p>
					These posts will usually be about a project I've either just started or just finished, including a
					link to their GitHub repository.
					The posts will be about the process of designing the project from start to finish, including certain
					parts that I think are interesting or were difficult to implement.
					Some parts that were a particular pain will get their own blog post, where I'll be able to talk
					about why it was so difficult and why I wanted to do it a certain way.
					<p></p>
					As well as my own projects, I may talk about things I'm currently interested in, and why I think you should be interested too!
					I may also provide a slightly more detailed explination of certain parts of the code, explaining why I
					used it and why I think it is particularly interesting or useful.
					Enjoy!
