# Skills

## C#
- [Earth Rescue](https://github.com/caseyhenderson/EarthRescue) (2017-2018) - Environmentally-themed infinite runner game built mainly for mobile but has desktop version too. Ran on C# and used the Unity engine. Created alongside [Casey Henderson](https://caseyhenderson.github.io/).
- [A-Level Chemistry Revision](https://github.com/Cameron-Leech-Thomson/A-Level-Chem_Resource) (2018) - Proof of concept of an AS/A-Level Chemistry Revision resource. Built using C# and the Unity UI engine. Contained various pages, including textbook-style pages on topics, with randomly generated questions on various topics, match-up games, and definition quizzes. Made as A-Level Computer Science coursework.

## Java
- [Card Games](https://github.com/Cameron-Leech-Thomson/card_games) (2020) - A small project I undertook to create a few card games that I enjoyed in Java. Rummy (up to 4 players), Poker (up to 4 players), Solitaire. Extra files are in the repository as I began to change all of the games into object-oriented, but eventually lost interest so this feature is lacking.

## Python
- A series of small, basic projects (~2015) - Projects undertaken by myself to start learning to code. Began with C#, but quickly switched to Python. Most of these projects have been lost and those that remain are too basic to be worth uploading - like I said, it was when I first started coding.

## Ruby
- [Online Departmental Bookmarking System](https://github.com/Cameron-Leech-Thomson/Bookmark_System) (2020) - Created as part of a software development team as a University project. A server-based bookmark system that allows users from multiple departments to save, favourite, share, comment, and rate different bookmarks for sites that would be useful per department and across the whole company. Included a login system with guest login, employee login, and admin login. All with different rights and privileges. Built using Ruby, Sinatra (Ruby Gem), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite3. 

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [Online Departmental Bookmarking System](https://github.com/Cameron-Leech-Thomson/Bookmark_System) (2020) - See above.
