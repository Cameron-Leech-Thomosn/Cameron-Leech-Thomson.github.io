The 2021/2022 university year was the final year of my undergraduate course at The University of Sheffield. Over the year I was tasked with completing my dissertation project along with my other modules. I missed the chance to accept one of the proposed projects from the Computer Science staff, so I was left to propose my own project, which was exciting but pretty daunting at the same time. Early in 2021 I'd gotten an [Oculus Quest 2](https://store.facebook.com/gb/en/quest/products/quest-2/?utm_source=www.google.com&utm_medium=oculusredirect), and got into the idea of developing something for VR - this was my perfect opportunity. So I proposed the idea of making a virtual reality simulation. Originally I wasn't sure what to make it on, until one of my friends suggested Special Relativity, which seemed like a good idea as I'm interested in physics, and I had two housemates studying it. The perfect arrangement!

## Where to Start?

At first I felt a little lost, as development tools for VR are still somewhat sparse, but after a while, I realised that Unity has probably the best support I can get for such an undertaking. So I started with some tutorials on how to develop for VR, as well as looking at the Oculus documentation, as well as Unity's XR Development Toolkit, which I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to start VR development. It's very user friendly, and you can take a look at it [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@1.0/manual/index.html) (and if you're looking for the Scripting API, [click here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@1.0/api/index.html)). After making a start with the Unity tutorials, I felt ready to start on my own project.

## Special Relativity

Special Relativity is the theory that describes the way that speed affects mass and time, which are most noticible when moving at a significant portion of the speed of light. It came from Albert Einstein's 1905 paper '[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies](https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~rtaylor/teaching/specrel.pdf)'. Even if you've never heard of special relativity, you've definitely heard of one of the results of that paper - the relation between mass and energy - $$ e = mc^2 $$. Throughout my dissertation paper I used the example of a paperclip, and I'll do the same here. To put that equation into perspective, turning a paperclip into pure energy would result in about the same amount of energy being released as 'Little Boy' - the 15 kiloton atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War. There were four main areas of special relativity that I wanted to focus on, which I'll briefly explain below. They are:

- Effects on Mass
- Length Contractions
- Doppler Shift
- Gravity (although this isn't a relativistic effect)

### Effects on Mass



### Length Contractions



### Doppler Shift



### Gravity
