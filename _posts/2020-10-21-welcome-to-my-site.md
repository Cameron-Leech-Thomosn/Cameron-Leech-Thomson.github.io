## About Me
Hi! I'm Cameron, I'm a {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2001 }} year old, Computer Science graduate from The University of Sheffield. I've created this website as a portfolio to show the projects that I make, whether they're University work or just for my own amusement. This way I can have all my projects in one place for everyone to see! If you want to take a more in-depth look at my projects, the blog posts about them will come with a link to their GitHub repository. If you want to have a look over all of them, take a look at my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/Cameron-Leech-Thomson)!
Usually, I'll post when a new project is uploaded. However, if I find something particularly interesting while doing a project, that topic might get its own blog post. I hope you enjoy!

## What to Expect from This Site
### New Projects
As well as using Git to keep track of my projects, their progress and results will be documented here. It's a much nicer space than Git when posting for specific projects, as I can talk in detail about whatever I like. These projects will be a mix of University work and things I do for fun. Unfortunately some University projects might not have all of the commits documented as I have to use a separate version of Git when doing those, but the finished result will be there!

### Blog Posts
I'll normally be posting on the blog every time I finish a new project. I'll talk about the process of creating the project, as well as how the final result works. I'll try to keep it short but I have a problem with waffling. In these posts, I'll talk about how I decided on each part of the process and why I think it's better than an alternative. If you'd like to tell me why I'm wrong, feel free to do so with the message board in the footer! As well as the project posts, I may post about specific parts of a project in more detail, for example, if I am particularly proud of a certain part of the code, or if it was a pain to get to work.

## Finally
This project was helped greatly by my good friend and fellow Computer Science extraordinaire [Casey Henderson](https://caseyhenderson.github.io). If you'd like to see what he gets up to, you can find his own website [here](https://caseyhenderson.github.io)! He recently released a new app on the app store, documenting the stadiums of teams across all 4 leagues of English football, and you can find it on the [apple store here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/stadiums/id1522026145). 

Thanks for visiting!
