# The Site
> This site has been created as a portfolio for me - Cameron Leech-Thomson

It contains the Jekyll layout 'Massively', created by [@ajlkn](https://twitter.com/ajlkn) for HTML5 UP, and adapted to Jekyll by [Somiibo](https://itwcreativeworks.com/).
See a preview of the Massively Jekyll Theme here: [https://iwiedenm.github.io/jekyll-theme-massively/](https://iwiedenm.github.io/jekyll-theme-massively/). <br>
Massively was originally designed by HTML5UP and Jekyll was integrated by [JekyllUp: Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllup.com)

This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)
